Git Workflow

Our team follows an organized branch system to keep development clean and collaborative:

The main branch contains the stable and final version of the project.

The develop branch is used to integrate all new features before release.

Each member works on their own branch named feature/membername-taskname, created from develop.

Once their part is complete, each member merges their feature branch into develop to combine everyoneâ€™s progress.

Finally, when the project is ready for delivery, develop is merged into main to generate the release version.
